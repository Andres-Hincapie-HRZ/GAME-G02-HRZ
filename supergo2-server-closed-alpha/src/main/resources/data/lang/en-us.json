Not because the commander of the fleet is particularly deadly, but because the commander she seems consumed by a personal quest. Dilira had lived a happy life on a peaceful planet in a remote sector of the Alliance, until the day the pirates came. They entered her sector and lay waste to each planet they came across, until they reached hers. Watching from orbit, she saw the pirates bombard the planet to oblivion after they had stolen everything of value. This burned into her very soul the need for survival. She knew she had to survive long enough to exact revenge, and once that was done she had to ensure it never happened to another world. She accomplished the first not long after graduating from the Galactic Academy, with a legendary battle that is more often described as a massacre. Her instinct for survival and her passion for her job have led her to develop some of the best defensive tactics of any commander – ever.

However, most students put that theory in the back of their minds as they load their ships up with as much weapons and armor as they can. This often lead to chuckles from a bright young recruit named Hellen. She was the daughter of a wealthy businessman and had learned from a young age that everything costs, and the only way to come out on top was to be more efficient than your opponent, whether in the boardroom or on the battlefield. Often wielding what seemed to be weak arsenals or deficient ship designs, she always seemed to come out on top - and much to their astonishment - usually within a few short minutes. The ability to quickly examine and determine the best use for products in business that she picked up following her father around the galaxy, provided the basis for an almost savant-like ability to select seemingly mismatched parts and equipment that perfectly complimented each other. Her ability to do so much with so little extended to the firing range as well. While most of the guys delighted in firing off as many rounds as the instructors would allow, they often failed to destroy their targets. However, Hellen usually needed only a few shots before her target was destroyed. Always efficient, and always ruthless, since graduating, Hellen has earned a reputation as a lethal adversary that will wait for the right moment to strike, and then with a few shots destroy her target and move on to the next victim.",

The funny thing is, looking back on Todd's career now makes it all too easy to say that he was destined to be a great commander. The kind of pressure he faced when he became the youngest ever to attempt the deadly commander exams, or the defeat (while still in school) of Red Beard's Pirate fleets on a dare, or any of his other achievements, is almost unthinkable. To have survived that kind of pressure, let alone thrive in it, is what really sets Todd apart from your average commander. It is his unique vision of the battlefield and his ability to quickly see the angles and relay orders under fire that makes Todd a living legend.
